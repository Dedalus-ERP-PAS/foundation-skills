# Coding Standards

Universal coding standards, best practices, and patterns for TypeScript, JavaScript, React, and Node.js development.

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive coding standards covering:
- Code quality principles (KISS, DRY, YAGNI)
- TypeScript/JavaScript best practices
- React patterns and hooks
- API design standards
- File organization
- Performance optimization
- Testing guidelines
- Code smell detection

## Usage

Reference this skill when:
- Starting new projects
- Reviewing code
- Establishing team standards
- Refactoring existing code
- Training new developers

## Key Principles

1. **Readability First** - Code is read more than written
2. **Type Safety** - Use proper TypeScript types, avoid `any`
3. **Immutability** - Always use spread operators, never mutate directly
4. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive try-catch with meaningful errors
5. **Testing** - Use AAA pattern with descriptive test names
